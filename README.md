# Video Streaming MERN App

This project was inspired by the YouTube channel "Chai and Code" and has been customized with several modifications. The focus has been on developing a robust backend for a video streaming application using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), bcrypt, and other technologies. The backend functionalities include user authentication (login, signup), video upload, like, dislike, comment, reply, subscribe, and unsubscribe features.

## Database Model
You can view the database model [here](https://app.eraser.io/workspace/YtPqZ1VogxGy1jzIDkzj).

## Frontend Development
The frontend development is currently in progress. I have found a great resource for building the frontend using plain HTML and Tailwind CSS components from [devuiv2.vercel.app](https://devuiv2.vercel.app/templates/youtube). To make things more organized, I've created a dedicated repository for the frontend part, which can be found [here](https://github.com/princekumarg/Videotube).

### Features
- Login and signup forms
- Video upload functionality
- Like, dislike, comment, and reply on videos
- Subscribe and unsubscribe to channels

## Usage
1. Clone the frontend repository: `git clone https://github.com/princekumarg/Videotube`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`
